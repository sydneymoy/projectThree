# About
**Happy Paws Adoption** is a website designed to raise awareness about dog adoption, fostering, and volunteer opportunities at local shelters such as ***Rocket Dog Rescue*** and ***Oakland Animal Rescue.*** The festival aims to connect the **Oakland** community with ways to help reduce shelter overcrowding and provide loving homes for pets in need. By offering a platform for local shelters, the festival allows them to showcase adoptable dogs, promote volunteering, and foster compassion and responsibility toward animals in need.

The **Happy Paws Adoption Festival** is a **three-day event** that brings together dog lovers, local businesses, and adoption advocates. The festival will feature 5k run, meet-and-greet petting zones, and vendor markets, offering opportunities for education, inspiration, and enjoyment for animal lovers of all ages. This event is designed to highlight the importance of adoption, encourage community engagement, and provide a space to support local shelters.

Taking place in Oakland, Happy Paws Adoption Festival is scheduled for a weekend event, providing a vibrant setting for families, dog enthusiasts, and individuals interested in making a difference. This festival seeks to raise awareness while fostering a deeper commitment to animal welfare and the adoption process.
